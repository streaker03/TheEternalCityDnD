  
- Notes 
	- A thin stone building that curves around a cliff overlooking the docks to the bright sea
	- The inside of the inn radiates extravagance of a time long past, chipped paint, cheaply fixed and retouched furniture, and a wall to wall fireplace that seems it hasn't been properly used in a generation
	- The night before was rough, a strong storm passed through and it's hard to sleep when the inn creaks and cracks right over a cliff
